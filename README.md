# Circuit Logic Simulator
This is a simple logic circuit simulator that can simulate the behavior of a logic circuit. The simulator can simulate the behavior of a logic circuit.
This should make it easy to understand how a logic circuit works and how it behaves.

## Usage
To create input nodes, click on the left side, and to create output nodes, click on the right side.
You can link the nodes by dragging the mouse from one node to another.
To add a chip to the circuit, drag it from the side panel and drop it onto the circuit board.
To create a custom chip, build a circuit on the board and then click "SAVE CHIP".
